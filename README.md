# AQI Quality Levels Checker App

## Description

In light of the recent wildfires going on, this AQI checker was created so users can check the air quality in their nearest area.

## What I Learned:

_.env:_ environment files allow you to store sensitive information. Here we have my specific token ID

_async/await/promises:_ async/await makes it easier to use and understand promises. Promises represent whether an async function gets completed or fails, allowing you to handle the results with a callback. Await waits for the promise inside the async function to be rejected or completed, Using these methods, we call the city the user inputs, and fetches that response from the API.

_try/catch:_ this method is used to prevent errors or crashing when something is expected to return. When the user enters a city, the data should return; if the city is not found then the user will see the error message.
